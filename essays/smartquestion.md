## Questions from a Smart Perspective

Who, what, when, where, and why? Perfectly describes the essential information needed to understand the context behind a well-crafted story. Similarly, software engineers have to paint stories about their code to provide themselves and others rooms to debug and understand the code. Though the ego might get in the way, at some point or another we will need to ask for assistance to our problems. The learning process involves failing, and with that process comes questions. However, not all questions come in the same sizes. Though your teacher might say "There is no such things as a bad question", there are questions that result in unsatisfactory answers. I think we all experience moments in time, where we come out more confused then you did before. This could partial be attributed to the way you have formatted the questions. Therefore, smart software engineers should strive to fail but to ask well-crafted quesstions to gain new knowledge. 

Note: this last paragraph is really rough please fix

## Smart Question, A New Hope

A lot of us have ran into errors, and this person on Stack Overflow is not the expection. This person is trying to figure out why he is getting the error "Bad state: Stream has already been listened to.", but he did not just straight into Stack Overflow to post a response. They did some research beforehand by searching different forums for similar problems regarding their use of dart streams for event handling. Then, after all that research and not being able to find a clear answer, they then resulted to Stack Overflow to find fellow software engineers to see if they have further wisdom about the predictament they are having. On top of that, this user has provided both code snippets between his working code and the one that has been giving him the error. This illustrates the work they have done and what they are working on currently. And with a well-crafted question comes a satisfactory answer, the responder was able to provide insight regarding asBroadcastStream(). This helped gain some functionality that the user has missed and better understand the code he has worked on.


## Smart Question, A Terrible Sequel

This person is trying to get notifications when the code copilot agent finished its task. However, this person seemed like they did some light researching regarding the problem, and give up entirely to and relied solely on asking somebody. This resulted in no one responding to this question, as it is poorly written and sounds a bit entitled to an answer regarding their specific task. A response that I could imagine if given the time of day would be to ask the person to do a bit more research into the matter and design a more well defined idea of a reason and pictures of what they tried to do. 


## The End of a Question, The Beginning of More

Questions, the birth of curiosity and knowledge. And being able to utilize it in your toolset, you will thank yourself later. Smart questions are the way you can communicate not only in software engineering, but other aspects of life. The way one crafts a question is the way one lets others into the way your code is written and understand the perspective that you come from. This helps yourself and other understand where are coming from and the mistakes that you have been making. Therefore it is important to have well-crafted questions to develop satisfactory answers and the development hole you might be in. So being alert about the problem and doing your best to solve it first, then ask has been very appreciated because it shows that you have tried and need just a bit more assistance.
