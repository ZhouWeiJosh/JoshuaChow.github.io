## Questions from a Smart Perspective

Who, what, when, where, and why? The five W's serve an important role in understanding the context behind a story. Similarly, we software engineers owe it to others and ourselves to paint these stories with our code. This allows room for gaining a deeper understanding for the craft and debugging. However, being able to ask questions is just as vital for growing as a software engineer. Though many of us would like to do everything ourselves, we do not have answers to everything and prohibiting ourselves from finding it will in the long run cause more problems. This does not mean that every question asked is a good question contrary to what some teachers might say. Since engineers are problem solvers, we must first attack the problem ourselves and then after exhausting our resources we ask thought-provoking, well-crafted questions. The last thing you want is to ask a question, and come back more confused or lost then you came in. And all of us have experienced that feeling, and that is partially due to the way we choose to ask the question. A simple "I do not know how this works" will not suffice. It takes a smart software engineer time to pinpoint the problem at hand and present it in a way that we are able to give a satisfactory answer.

## Smart Question, A New Hope

Stack Overflow is a Q&A forum that connects users like you and I to collaborate on a variety of programming problems/issues. Before the advent of chatbots such as ChatGPT and Copilot, this served as a great way to connect with very knowledgable people and get your questions answered. Also, it serves as a great place to find people who are good at asking smart questions. One of them was this user who was getting a "Bad state: Stream has already been listened to.", which relates to their implementation of dart streams for event handling. They prefaced the whole question by giving us some background on the work that he has done for this specific issues, with them talking about going through multiple platforms and not finding a clear answer. To me this shows some initiative and leads me to be more inclined to the problem that this user is discussing. Furthermore, this user was able to give us some of his code snippets to drive straight into.

These code snippets are not screenshots and are formatted in a way that provides the least amount of work to access. Thus, with a smart question comes a satisfactory answer indicated with the green checkmark. The responder was able to call on his knowledge about the asBroadcastStream() and discovery that the issues coming from the creation of a unknown broadcast stream. This hopefully allowed the original poster the chance to learn about this function a bit more and reimplement the code in a way to fit their needs. The results of this smart question allowed for this poster to have a small collaboration with a different user and build upon his knowledge. Creating a situation in where both parties were able to either help or gain insight into something new.


## Smart Question, The Last Terrible Sequel

This 

This person is trying to get notifications when the code copilot agent finished its task. However, this person seemed like they did some light researching regarding the problem, and give up entirely to and relied solely on asking somebody. This resulted in no one responding to this question, as it is poorly written and sounds a bit entitled to an answer regarding their specific task. A response that I could imagine if given the time of day would be to ask the person to do a bit more research into the matter and design a more well defined idea of a reason and pictures of what they tried to do. 


## The End of a Question, The Beginning of More

Questions, the birth of curiosity and knowledge. And being able to utilize it in your toolset, you will thank yourself later. Smart questions are the way you can communicate not only in software engineering, but other aspects of life. The way one crafts a question is the way one lets others into the way your code is written and understand the perspective that you come from. This helps yourself and other understand where are coming from and the mistakes that you have been making. Therefore it is important to have well-crafted questions to develop satisfactory answers and the development hole you might be in. So being alert about the problem and doing your best to solve it first, then ask has been very appreciated because it shows that you have tried and need just a bit more assistance.
