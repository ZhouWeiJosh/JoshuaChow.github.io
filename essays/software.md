## Software Engineering the Intro

Software engineering is the process in which software/code is developed, tested, and maintained. Think of the websites you visit daily, that in itself is part of the software engineering cycle albeit probably in the maintanance phase. However, this process is all but foreign to me with some key phrases being brought up here and there. Such as the agile model and waterfall that describes certain processes of development. But now this semester, I am taking a a course on software engineering and will finally understand what that many of this will mean. 

## The Hook

Since I have worked on big teams with large codebases, I am interested in how people are able to work together in a manner that allows for the fast and efficient development of their systems. I personally had issues with GitHub branches and remerging them back into the main branch. Which made me reevaluate the process in which a big team should function with a project that requires a lot of development. Another thing that has interested me was writing tests that help make sure the code is functioning properly. I did write some unit tests for a class while learning C/C++, but that was very minimal and I want it from a software engineering perspective. 


## The End?

The most important aspect to me about software engineering is learning about the principles to quickly and efficiently develop software for huge overarching projects such as website development. Being able to harness this knowledge and apply it to a different part of my life would be ideal for understanding and utilizing software principles to propel the skills that I have now. I am still a novice programmer, and I want to be able to continue to improve and learn.

## Fun Fact
Javascript has no resemblance to Java even though they share a common name.
