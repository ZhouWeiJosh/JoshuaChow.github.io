## Typescript, A Bit Too Much

Coming from a C/C++ background, Typescript, superset of Javascript, serves as a similar yet frustating language. From the scoping problems when using var to the confusing syntax, those aspects play a role in the growing pains of getting through the basics. On the otherhand, I appreciate the built-in functions regarding array managment, such as push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift(), which are not natively built into programs like C. However, with any sort of new language, there will be times where frustration comes from the lack of knowledge rather than the language itself. So it is important to take these points given with a grain of salt. 

One of my main frustations with Typescript is the way they implement static types. Syntactically I am very used to having types be declared before the variable name is even invoked. 

`int num = 20; // C`

Whereas in Typescript you have to invoke it with both let/const and the variable name followed by the special type.

`let num: number = 20; // Typescript`

Which brings me to the point about destructing assignments, that I currently find really difficult to grasp onto since it has been hard-coded into me to write it in a more standard way. As a beginniner coming from quite a different language, I think it will take a lot of time and practice to get use to. Despite that, I do find that it is harder to read intiutively and makes peer programming a bit more difficulty.

Moving onto some positives regarding Typescript, I really do appreciate the built-in functions with array management. In the C programming language, there are no built-in functions thus we have to deal with pointers which are quite complex. So being able to have function calls for structing dynamic arrays is very much appreciated. Another thing that I quite liked about this superset of Javascript is the function charAt(), which yet again does not exist in C which primarily uses char arrays. However, it is important to note that the lack of these features could be due to how low level it is as a programming language.

## Software Engineering from a Team Perspective

Under the vertically integrated project (VIP), Team RoSE, which each year develops a mock Mars rover for a international competition serves to benefit from a bit of software engineering. Though unlike the contents of this class that primarily focuses on Typescript and other web development tools, the team works closer to the hardware requiring a framework called ROS2 and working with languages such as C++ and Python. Having a bigger team inquires more task that need to be delegated and more risk on time. Therefore, to better increase the time management and productivity pipeline, I think it is wildy important to move away from a more amateur approach to product development and testing. It just makes me think about the freedom that languages like Typescript provide and how that sometimes can be cumbersome to understand. Having a clear and concise way of doing things brings out a combined sense of knowledge gained. For example, if you work in peers and utilizing a coding convention it puts people on the same page instantly. Therefore, to me a language like Typescript needs to me more direct and not closed ended about the approach of certain variables or functions.

## Going from Typing to Scripting

Typescript is an interesting language and though I may have some grips with the idiosyncrasies within it, I think I will understand its purpose more and more as my software engineering course progresses. When I first went through the basics, I realized like real world languages, there are similarties and different approaches. To me it makes it specialized to the purpose and the user. This is just another tool that you can take out of your toolbox, and though sometimes it will not be the right one. However, when that sometimes comes, you will have more than enough knowledge to apply it.

## Fun Fact
Javascript has no resemblance to Java even though they share a common name.
