Team Robotic Space Exploration, Team RoSE, is the robotics team in the University of Hawaii at Manoa which specializes in creating a mock Mars rover for a international competition called URC, University Rover Challenge. 

The competition is broken down into four main missions: 

- **Science**

  A mission that involves collecting a soil sample from various sites to preform basic science evaluation of the sample onboard. In order to discover if there were any microbial life that was acquired from the sample sites.

- **Delivery**

  A teleoperated mission that involves the rover finding, picking up, and delivering objects to astronauts on the field while also traversing through terrain of increasing difficulty.

- **Equipment Servicing**

  A teleoperated mission that requires the rover to interact with a mock lander to preform a certain task, including undoing a latch, opening a drawer, and typing in a launch key. Culmating in the precise movement of both the robotic arm and differential drive.

- **Autonomous Navigation**

  The rover autonomously must travel to two GNSS location, three post with AR tags, and two objects which requires a careful balance of sensors to approximate its location and movement.

Initially, I joined as a way to continue the passion I had towards the field of robotics. And through this student lead project, I was able to learn more about C++ and the framework ROS/ROS2. The ROS, robot operating system, framework is a framework used for building robotic systems. It essentially works by having publishers and subscribers to communicate data between the different sensors within the robot. Specifically we are using the sequel to ROS, ROS2 to implement our own robotic system for the rover. During my first year, I primilarily worked under my lead on developing software for getting GPS coordinates for feeding into the Extended Kalman Filter.

This past school year, I took on more of a leadership role that involved management of the entire software team. Including running weekly meetings, tracking the progess of the different sub-disciplines, and of course developing the software, mostly the differential drive for me. Though that only describes only this sub-discipline as we also have the mechanical and electrical team.

Here's a quick video that encapsulates the progress made last school year: [Team RoSE URC 2025 SAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVW3kchtqlg)
