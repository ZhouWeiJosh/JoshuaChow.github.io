Team Robotic Space Exploration, Team RoSE, is the robotics team in the University of Hawaii at Manoa which specializes in creating a mock Mars rover for a international competition called URC, University Rover Challenge. 

The competition is broken down into four main missions: 

  Delivery

  A teleoperated mission that involves the rover finding, picking up, and delivering objects to astronauts on the field        while also traversing through terrain of increasing difficulty


Initially, I joined as a way to continue the passion I had 

Vacay is a web application that I helped create as a team project in ICS 415, Spring 2015. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. 

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
